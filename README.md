## Usage

Usage instructions:

1. Users can draw a number in the provided canvas area.
2. Select `Recognize` in order to submit the canvas data to brain.js.
3. After the image has processed users will see the confidence values of the top two interpretations.
4. The user can clear and try again.  Try drawing smaller and near the center if you are encountering issues with recognition.
